\section{First Section}

This is the main theorem restated:
\begin{restatable}[Main theorem]{theorem}{mainclaim}
    We have
    \begin{equation}
        1 + 2 = 3 .
    \end{equation}
\end{restatable}

\section{Second Section}

This is a dummy theorem to check the equation counter:
\begin{theorem} We have
    \begin{equation}
        0 \neq 1 .
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Restated here:
\mainclaim*

This is another dummy equation:
\begin{equation}
    1 \neq 2 .
\end{equation}
